                    utilizes such special link formats. Links to

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold py-2">Referral fees/commissions and payment</h2>
                <p>
                    For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a referral fee, the customer
                    must click-through a Special Link from your site, email, or other
                    communications to&nbsp;https://GetSmurf.com&nbsp;and complete an
                    order for a product during that session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will only pay commissions on links that are automatically tracked
                    and reported by our systems. We will not pay commissions if someone
                    says they purchased or someone says they entered a referral code if it
                    was not tracked by our system. We can only pay commissions on business
                    generated through properly formatted special links that were
                    automatically tracked by our systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to disqualify commissions earned through
                    fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or
                    marketing methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payments only begin once you&rsquo;ve earned more
                    than&nbsp;$20&nbsp;in affiliate income. If your affiliate account
                    never crosses the&nbsp;$20&nbsp;threshold, your commissions will not
                    be realized or paid. We are only responsible for paying accounts that
                    have crossed the&nbsp;$20&nbsp;threshold.

                <p>
                    You may not issue any press release with respect to this Agreement or
                    your participation in the Program; such action may result in your
                    termination from the Program. In addition, you may not in any manner
                    misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us and you, say you
                    develop our products, say you are part of&nbsp;GetSmurf&nbsp;or
                    express or imply any relationship or affiliation between us and you or
                    any other person or entity except as expressly permitted by this
                    Agreement (including by expressing or implying that we support,
                    sponsor, endorse, or contribute money to any charity or other cause).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may not purchase products through your affiliate links for your
                    own use. Such purchases may result (in our sole discretion) in the
                    withholding of referral fees and/or the termination of this Agreement.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold py-2">Payment schedule</h2>
                <p>
                    As long as your current affiliate earning are over&nbsp;$20,
                    you&rsquo;ll be paid each month. If you haven&rsquo;t
                    earned&nbsp;$20&nbsp;since your last payment, we&rsquo;ll pay you the
                    following month after you&rsquo;ve crossed the threshold.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold py-2">Customer definition</h2>
                <p>
                    Customers who buy products through this Program will be deemed to be
                    our customers. Accordingly, all of our rules, policies, and operating
                    procedures concerning customer orders, customer service, and product
                    sales will apply to those customers. We may change our policies and
                    operating procedures at any time. For example, we will determine the
                    prices to be charged for products sold under this Program in
                    accordance with our own pricing policies. Product prices and
                    availability may vary from time to time. Because price changes may
                    affect Products that you have listed on your site, you should not
                    display product prices on your site. We will use commercially
                    reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot
                    guarantee the availability or price of any particular product.

                <p>
                    Any dispute relating in any way to this Agreement (including any
                    actual or alleged breach hereof), any transactions or activities under
                    this Agreement or your relationship with us or any of our affiliates
                    shall be submitted to confidential arbitration, except that, to the
                    extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our
                    intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other
                    appropriate relief in any state or federal court (and you consent to
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts) or any other
                    court of competent jurisdiction. Arbitration under this agreement
                    shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American
                    Arbitration Association. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be binding
                    and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
                    jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no
                    arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration
                    involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through
                    class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
